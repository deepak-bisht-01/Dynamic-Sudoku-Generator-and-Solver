# Dynamic-Sudoku-Generator-and-Solver
Programming language- python
This project is to create an interactive Sudoku solver and generator for NxN puzzles. With Python and Tkinter as the GUI, the solver uses Backtracking, Constraint Propagation, and Branch and Bound algorithms to solve puzzles efficiently. Users can manually enter puzzles, create random puzzles, and visualize solving step-by-step. Optimizations for quick solving and uniqueness of puzzles are also included. Libraries such as NumPy are utilized for effective grid management
